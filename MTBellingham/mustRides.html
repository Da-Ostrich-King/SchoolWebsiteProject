                    Here are some must rides for Galbraith Mountain that everyone should ride at LEAST once.

                <h2>North Side</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>SST</li>
                    <p>
                        SST is an amazing trail featuring jumps and gaps at the top and amazing flow and unique features as you ride down, 
                        and a world class rock roll/drop that is definetely something to ride or work up to.
                    </p>
                    <li>Cedar Dust</li>
                    <p>
                        Cedar Dust is less of a single trail and more of a small set of trails all in the same area. Cedar Dust features green through black drop lines which are short and provide 
                        a progression for the rider. There is also and green through double black jump lines which are the areas main attraction. In my opinion, the green lines aren't worth riding, 
                        but all the others are definitely worth checking out.
                    </p>
                    <li>Bob's Trail</li>
                    <p>
                        Bob's Trail is a short trail that has many small but fun features, great for a warmup or exit lap. The climb is about 30-45 minutes and the descent about 20.
                    </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Evolution</li>
                    <p>
                        Evolution is a trail that is known for having amazing wood features and good progression. 
                        About half way through it splits to a double black line and a blue line, both of which are very 
                        approachable and after some work, both are definetely masterable.
                    </p>
                    <li>Unemployement Line</li>
                    <p>
                        Unemployement Line, also known as U-Line, is a trail known for it's flow and jumps. It is one of the only 
                        machine groomed trails on the mountain. It has many optional gaps, and many jumps have option larger bits that 
                        you can ride when you're ready.
                    </p>
                    <li>Mowhawk</li>
                    <p>
                        Mowhawk is a black jump trail, it could easily be ridden as a blue as most of the difficult features can be 
                        ridden around, or are optional in the first place. At the end it has multiple lines that come off, including 
                        a pro line with large gaps, and down to a blue line with moderate tables. Mowhawk is definetely a must when riding here.
                    </p>
                    <li>Meth Lab</li>
                    <p>
                        Meth Lab is a short blue trail that is best ridden at the end of the ride, as it takes you most of the way to the parking 
                        lot. It is nice and fun, definetely not the main attraction of the day, but easy to ride out as it is only about a 10-15 minute 
                        climb from the exit of most trails on south side.
                    </p>
                    <li>Blue Ribbon</li>
                    <p>
                        Blue Ribbon is a black flow jump trail, it is like U-Line but just more everything, it is very swoopy.
                    </p>
                    <li>Atomic Dog</li>
                    <p>
                        Atomic Dog is a fun trail with a bit of everything on it, it has some light tech, some jumps, drops, and 
                        a large wallride for which the trail is known for.
